            Enumerations are graphs used as controlled vocabularies whose elements are terms. \
            At the root of the graph is a term that represents the type or definition of this \
            controlled vocabulary, this term represents the enumeration graph.
            
            This service can be used to retrieve the path between the enumeration root term \
            and a term that matches the provided local identifier. The \`path\` parameter represents the \
            global identifier of the enumeration root or type, the \`code\` parameter is the local identifier \
            of a term among the enumeration elements that you want to match: if matched, the service \
            will return the path from the root of the enumeration to the first term whose (\`_lid\`) \
            matches the provided code. If no match is found, the service will return an empty array.
            
            You can try providing \`_type\` as the \`path\` and \`string\` as the code: this should \
            return the string data type term belonging to the data types controlled vocabulary.
            
            Note that this service will honour preferred enumerations, this means that if a term \
            is matched that has a preferred alternative, the latter will be returned, regardless \
            if the preferred term does not belong to the provided path.
            
            You can try providing \`iso_639_1\` as the \`path\` and \`eng\` as the code: this should \
            return the preferred term for the English language which is \`iso_639_3_eng\`. Note that \
            the actual match is \`iso_639_1_en\`, but this term points to a preferred alternative \
            which is the returned result: this means that the \`en\` local identifier will not be \
            matched, this service expects only preferred local identifiers.
