            The value will be validated against the data definition associated with the descriptor \
            and the service will return an object describing the status of the validation and eventual \
            additional information describing the outcome.
            
            Optionally, it is possible to indicate in which language the status message should be returned.

            - \`descriptor\`: The descriptor global identifier.
            - \`value\`: The value to be tested against the descriptor's data definition.
            - \`language\`: The \`iso_396_3\` language for status messages.
            
            The first two parameters are *required*, the last parameter is *optional*.
            
            The \`language\` code is used to select the *language* of the *status message*:

            *all available languages*,
            - if the language code is *wrong*, or there is *no message in that language*,
            the message will be returned in *English*.
            
            Language codes are in the form: \`iso_639_3_\` followed by the *three letter ISO language code*.

            **Validation status**
            
            The service will return three information items:
            - \`valid\`: List of valid data elements.
            - \`warnings\`: List of warning reports.
            - \`errors\`: List of error reports.
            
            Warning and error reports are objects with two elements:
            - \`value\`: The data element value.
            - \`status\`: The list of status messages one per property.
            
            Each data element is processed separately: if the data is valid, the data element will \
            be stored in the \`valid\` report property; if there is at least one error, the data element \
            and all the corresponding status reports will be stored in the \`errors\` report property; \
            if there is at least one warning, the data element and all the corresponding status reports \
            will be stored in the \`warnings\` report property.
            
            The returned value, \`value\`, may be *different* than the provided value, because enumerations
            can be *resolved*: if the enumeration code is *not* a *term global identifier*, the full
            enumeration graph will be traversed and the first element whose local identifier matches the provided
            value will be considered the valid choice. Try entering \`_type\` as descriptor and \`string\` as the
            value: you will see that the value will be resolved to the full code value, \`_type_string\`.
            
            The \`status\` objects indicate the outcome of the validation, they record any warning or error.
            This status has two default elements: a \`code\` that is a numeric code, \`0\` means success,
            and a \`message\` string that describes the outcome. Depending on the eventual error, the status may
            include other properties such as:
            - \`value\`: the value that caused the error.
            - \`descriptor\`: the descriptor involved in the error.
            - \`elements\`: in case an array has too little or too much elements.
            - \`property\`: missing required property, in case of incorrect data definition.
            - \`block\`: data definition section.
            - \`type\`: unimplemented or invalid data type, or data definition section name.
            - \`required\`: list of required properties, in case one is missing.
            - \`range\`: valid range, in the case of out of range values.
            - \`regexp\`: regular expression, in case a string does not match.
            
            Additional properties may be included in the result, depending on the eventual error, or in the event
            that an enumeration was resolved:
            - \`resolved\`: It is an object whose properties represent the enumeration descriptors whose values
            have been resolved, the values contain the original provided codes, while the \`value\` will contain the
            resolved values. Try entering \`_type\` as descriptor and \`string\` as the value.
            - \`ignored\`: It is an object whose properties represent the descriptors that were not recognised.
            Unknown descriptors will not be validated, this is not considered an error, but such descriptors will
            be logged, so that it is possible to catch eventual errors. Try entering \`UNKNOWN\` as descriptor.
            - \`error\`: In the event of unexpected database errors, this property will host the specific \
            error message generated by the database engine.

            - \`language\`: The global identifier of the language in which you want the \
            status message to be returned.
            
            The \`value\` is required and the \`language\` is optional. \
            The value should contain the list of objects to be validated, \
            please refer to the *"Validate descriptor value"* service \
            for information on how to use the \`language\` parameter.
            
            Each object will be validated using the same strategy as the \
            *Validate object* service.

            The service will return two information items:
            - \`value\`: The list of validated objects.
            - \`result\`: The status of the validation operation.
            
            The \`value\` objects may be different from what was provided: please refer to the \
            *"Validate object"* service for more information.
            
            The \`result\` will be an array in which each element will contain the validation \
            status for the corresponding element of the provided \`value\`. This means that \
            index \`3\` of the \`result\` array will be the validation status for the element \
            with index \`3\` in the \`value\` parameter.
            
            Please refer to the object validation service for more information on \
            the format of each individual status.
