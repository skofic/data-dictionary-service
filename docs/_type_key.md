### _type_key

#### Key data type

The data type of the dictionary key.

This field defines the data type of the dictionary key, it is an enumerated choice that can take the following values:

- [String](_type_string): A *character* or *text* encoded in UTF-8. The [data section](_data) can include the [regular expression](_regexp) property.
- [Key reference](_type_string_key): A [string](_type_string) representing the [global identifier](_gid) of a *document* from the *terms collection*. The [data section](_data) is *required* to include the [data kind](_kind) field which specifies the *kind of term*, these are the allowed choices:
    - [Any term](_any-term): The value can reference *any term* in the *terms collection*.
    - [Any enumeration](_any-enum): The value can reference *any term* *belonging* to a *controlled vocabulary*, this means that the *term* must be *referenced* in at least one *edge* with the [enumeration](_predicate_enum-of) [predicate](_predicate).
    - [Any structure](_any-object): The value can reference *any term* that *defines* an *object data structure*: such terms must have the [rules section](_rule) property.
    - [Any descriptor](_any-descriptor): The value can reference *any term* that *defines* a *descriptor*: such terms must have the [data section](_data) property.
- [Enumeration](_type_string_enum): A [string](_type_string) representing the [global identifier](_gid) of a *document* belonging to the *terms collection* that is part of a *controlled vocabulary*. The [data section](_data) can include the following properties: [format](_format), [unit](_unit), [unit name](_unit-name) and [regular expression](_regexp). In addition, the [data section](_data) *requires* the [data kind](_kind) field, that is *must* *specify* from which *controlled vocabulary* the value must be *chosen*.

When validating dictionary types, the *key* and *value* parts are *parsed* and *validated independently*, dictionary keys are not considered descriptors.

The [key type](_type_key) field is *required*.
