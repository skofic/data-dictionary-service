An edge is uniquely identified by its subject-predicate-object relationship. This means that many paths can traverse the same edge: these paths are identified by the graph root node, and the functional predicate characterising its path.\n\nPredicates are of three types: functional, container and bridge. Functional predicates determine what the current graph represents: a controlled vocabulary, a data structure type, etc. Nodes connected with such predicates are valid choices for that predicate. Container predicates are used to group child nodes under a common category that has no function, other\nthan to collect a set of choices. Bridge predicates are used to allow another graph (different root) to share the structure of the current graph. Edges also feature an object property that holds data that can be used during traversals.\n\nThis service can be used to create edges with functional predicates. The service expects the graph root node reference, which identifies the graph path, the parent and children node references to be connected, the functional predicate, the list of section predicates expected during traversals, the custom data associated with the edge and a set of flags governing the operation.\n\nThe request body should be provided with an object containing the following elements:\n\n- `children`: A key/value dictionary in which the key represents the child node document handle and the value represents custom data associated with the corresponding edge.\n  - `sections`: Graphs have predicates that indicate the type of graph: enumeration, field, etc. There are other predicates, however, whose goal is to link nodes which\nwill not have the function of the main predicate. The provided default values indicate sections, that represent display or category nodes used for subdividing child nodes, and bridges, which allow one node to connect to another node through a bridge node.\n\nThe values of the children dictionary can be the following:\n\n- `object`: This represents valid data for the edge, the provided object will be merged with the existing one. If you set a provided property value to null, if the property exists in the edge data, the service will delete that property from the existing data. If you want to ignore the value, pass an empty object.\n- `null`: If you provide this value the whole custom data container will be reset to an empty object.\n\nIf the edge does not exist, the provided data will be set in the edge, except for the properties that have a null value. If the edge exists, the parameters of the provided data will replace eventual existing matching parameters, or will be erased, if the value is null.\n\nThe service will do the following:\n\n- Assert that the parent node is connected to the root node.\n- If the subject-predicate-object combination does not exist, it will create an edge with the combination of the provided parent, the provided predicate and the current child, for the provided root. If custom data was provided, it will be set, or an empty object will be set.\n- If the subject-predicate-object combination exists:\n    - If the root is not among the paths it will be added, and the eventual custom data will replace or reset existing data.\n    - If the root is in the list of paths, the service will only handle the edge data.\n\nIf the service is successful, [`200`], it will return an object containign the following properties:\n\n  - `stats`:\n    - `inserted`: The number of inserted edges.\n    - `updated`: The number of updated edges.\n    - `existing`: The number of ignored existing edges.\n  - `inserted`: The list of inserted edges, if the inserted parameter was set.\n  - `updated`: The list of updated edger, if the updated \\ parameter was set.\n  - `existing`: The list of existing edges, if the existing parameter was set.\n\n\nIf the operation does not succeed, the service will return:\n\n- `400`: **Invalid reference**: the service will return this code if any provided term reference is invalid.\n- `401`: **No current user**: the service will return this code if no user is currently logged in.\n- `403`: **Unauthorised user**: the service will return this code if the current user is not an administrator.\n- `500`: For other types of error.",

An edge is uniquely identified by its subject-predicate-object relationship. This means that many paths can traverse the same edge: these paths are identified by the graph root node, and the functional predicate characterising its path.\n\nPredicates are of three types: functional, container and bridge. Functional predicates determine what the current graph represents: a controlled vocabulary, a data structure type, etc. Nodes connected with such predicates are valid choices for that predicate. Container predicates are used to group child nodes under a common category that has no function, other\nthan to collect a set of choices. Bridge predicates are used to allow another graph (different root) to share the structure of the current graph. Edges also feature an object property that holds data that can be used during traversals.\n\nThis service can be used to create edges with container predicates. The service expects the graph root node reference, which identifies the graph path, the parent and children node references to be connected, the functional predicate which identifies the functional paths of the graph, the container predicate to be set, the list of section and bridge predicates expected during traversals, the custom data associated with the edge and a set of flags governing the operation.\n\nThe request body should be provided with an object containing the following elements:\n\n- `children`: A key/value dictionary in which the key represents the child node document handle and the value represents custom data associated with the corresponding edge.\n- `sections`: Graphs have predicates that indicate the type of graph: enumeration, field, etc. There are other predicates, however, whose goal is to link nodes which\nwill not have the function of the main predicate. The provided default values indicate sections, that represent display or category nodes used for subdividing child nodes, and bridges, which allow one node to connect to another node through a bridge node.\n\nThe values of the children dictionary can be the following:\n\n- `object`: This represents valid data for the edge, the provided object will be merged with the existing one. If you set a provided property value to null, if the property exists in the edge data, the service will delete that property from the existing data. If you want to ignore the value, pass an empty object.\n- `null`: If you provide this value the whole custom data container will be reset to an empty object.\n\nIf the edge does not exist, the provided data will be set in the edge, except for the properties that have a null value. If the edge exists, the parameters of the provided data will replace eventual existing matching parameters, or will be erased, if the value is null.\n\nThe service will do the following:\n\n- Assert that the parent node is connected to the root node.\n- If the subject-predicate-object combination does not exist, it will create an edge with the combination of the provided parent, the container predicate and the current child, for the provided root. If custom data was provided, it will be set, or an empty object will be set.\n- If the subject-predicate-object combination exists:\n    - If the root is not among the paths it will be added, and the eventual custom data will replace or reset existing data.\n    - If the root is in the list of paths, the service will only handle the edge data.\n\nIf the service is successful, [`200`], it will return an object containign the following properties:\n\n  - `stats`:\n    - `inserted`: The number of inserted edges.\n    - `updated`: The number of updated edges.\n    - `existing`: The number of ignored existing edges.\n  - `inserted`: The list of inserted edges, if the inserted parameter was set.\n  - `updated`: The list of updated edger, if the updated \\ parameter was set.\n  - `existing`: The list of existing edges, if the existing parameter was set.\n\n\nIf the operation does not succeed, the service will return:\n\n- `400`: **Invalid reference**: the service will return this code if any provided term reference is invalid.\n- `401`: **No current user**: the service will return this code if no user is currently logged in.\n- `403`: **Unauthorised user**: the service will return this code if the current user is not an administrator.\n- `500`: For other types of error.",

An edge is uniquely identified by its subject-predicate-object relationship. This means that many paths can traverse the same edge: these paths are identified by the graph root node, and the functional predicate characterising its path.\n\nPredicates are of three types: functional, container and bridge. Functional predicates determine what the current graph represents: a controlled vocabulary, a data structure type, etc. Nodes connected with such predicates are valid choices for that predicate. Container predicates are used to group child nodes under a common category that has no function, other\nthan to collect a set of choices. Bridge predicates are used to allow another graph (different root) to share the structure of the current graph. Edges also feature an object property that holds data that can be used during traversals.\n\nThis service can be used to delete an edge with bridge predicate. The service expects the root node that will traverse the bridged root graph and the bridge predicate. The custom edge data is provided in the request body. The service also expects the functional predicate, that will be traversed if the prune flag was set, to delete leaf branches.\n\nThe body contains two properties:\n\n- `sections`: Graphs have predicates that indicate the type of graph: enumeration, field, etc. There are other predicates, however, whose goal is to link nodes which will not have the function of the main predicate. The provided default values indicate sections, that represent display or category nodes used for subdividing child nodes, and bridges, which allow one node to connect to another node through a bridge node.\n- `data`: An object containing the custom data for the current edge.\n\nThe body data property take the following values:\n\n- `object`: This represents valid data for the edge, the provided object will be merged with the existing one. If you set a provided property value to null, if the property exists in the edge data, the service will delete that property from the existing data. If you want to ignore the value, pass an empty object.\n- `null`: If you provide this value the whole custom data container will be reset to an empty object.\n\nThe service will do the following:\n\n- If the subject-predicate-object combination exists, it will delete the edge.\n    - If the prune flag is set, the service will delete all instances of the root in all paths featuring the provided predicate.\n\nIf the service is successful, [`200`], it will return an object containign the following properties:\n\n  - `stats`:\n    - `inserted`: The number of inserted edges.\n    - `updated`: The number of updated edges.\n    - `existing`: The number of ignored existing edges.\n  - `inserted`: The list of inserted edges, if the inserted parameter was set.\n  - `updated`: The list of updated edger, if the updated \\ parameter was set.\n  - `existing`: The list of existing edges, if the existing parameter was set.\n\n\nIf the operation does not succeed, the service will return:\n\n- `400`: **Invalid reference**: the service will return this code if any provided term reference is invalid.\n- `401`: **No current user**: the service will return this code if no user is currently logged in.\n- `403`: **Unauthorised user**: the service will return this code if the current user is not an administrator.\n- `500`: For other types of error.",
