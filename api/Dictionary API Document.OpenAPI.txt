The [data section](_data.md) is required to contain the [data kind](_kind.md) field, and these are the allowed choices:\n    - *A [global identifier](_gid.md)*: It must be one or more [key references](_type_string_key.md) to *terms* that define a *data structure type*, the term *must include* the [rules section](_rule.md).

No other [data section](_data.md) properties are expected.\n- [Integer](_type_integer.md): *Numeric discrete* value. The [data section](_data.md) can include the following properties: [unit](_unit.md), [unit name](_unit-name.md), [range](_range.md), [valid range](_valid-range.md) and [normal range](_normal-range.md).\n- [Numeric](_type_number.md): *Numeric discrete* or *continuous* value; will be considered a *floating point number*.

The [data section](_data.md) is required to contain the [data kind](_kind.md) field, and these are the allowed choices:\n    - *A [global identifier](_gid.md)*: It must be one or more [key references](_type_string_key.md) to *terms* that define a *data structure type*, the term *must include* the [rules section](_rule.md). This means that the value *must* be an *object* of *that type*.\n    - [Any structure](_any-object.md): The value can be an *object* of *any type*, but its *properties* will be *parsed* and *validated*. This means that only the *constraints* at the *object level* will be *ignored*.\n- [GeoJSON geometry](_type_object_geojson.md): An *object data structure* representing a *geographic structure* encoded in the [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org) data format. No other [data section](_data.md) properties are expected.\n\nIf *this property* is *omitted*, it means that the *value* can be of *any scalar type*."

Within the `iso_3166_1` [namespace](_nid.md), only *this* term can have this local identifier *code*.\n- [Global identifier](_gid.md): `iso_3166_1_ITA` is the *combination* of the [namespace](_nid.md), `iso_3166_1`, and the [local identifier](_lid.md), `ITA`, *joined* by the *underscore*, `_`, token. This represents the *unique identifier* of the *term*, meaning that there can *only be one term* featuring this [unique identifier](_gid.md). Note that this value will be copied in the document [key](_key.md).\n- [All identifiers](_aid.md): this *set* of *codes* collects all *identifiers* that *can be used* to *refer to* the *current term*. This is a *list* of *acronyms* that can safely be *associated* with the *term*. The [local identifier](_lid.md) *must* also be *included*. This means that `Italy` can be identified both with the *2-character* code `IT`, or with the *3-character* code `ITA`, which is the [local identifier](_lid.md) of the term.\n- [Name](_name.md): In *this case* it *makes sense* to include the *original name* of the term, which, is `Italia`, *Italy* in *Italian*. *This information should only be included if relevant*.\n- [Regular expression](_regexp.md): This represents a *pattern* to which the [local identifier](_lid.md) *must conform*. There is already a *regular expression* that *restricts all local identifiers*, the current [field](_regexp.md) can be used to *further restrict* the *pattern*. In this case the code must be composed of *three uppercase letters*.\n\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"_code\": {\n\t\t\"_lid\": \"iso\",\n\t\t\"_gid\": \"iso\",\n\t\t\"_aid\": [\"iso\"]\n\t}\n}\n```\nThis snippet shows the code definition of the *ISO* namespace.

          "description": "Use this service to get an enumeration flattened list of element records.\n\n*In order to use this service, the current user must have the `read` role*.\n\nThis service can be used to retrieve the *flattened list* of *term records* belonging to the *provided graph path term global identifier*.\n\n*Enumerations* are *a graph of nested trees* that represent *controlled vocabularies* whose *elements* are *terms*. At the *root* of the graph is a *term* that represents the *type* or *definition* of this *controlled vocabulary*: the `path` parameter is the *global identifier* of this *term*.\n\nThe service expects the global identifier of that term as the query path parameter, `path`.\n\nIf the service is successful, [`200`], it will return the list of all the enumeration elements belonging to the provided path parameter. The elements are returned as term records.\n\nNote that no hierarchy or order is maintained, it is a flat list of term records. Also, only items representing active elements of the enumeration will be selected: this means that terms used as sections or bridges will not be returned.\n\nIf the operation does not succeed, the service will return:\n\n- `401`: **No current user**: the service will return this code if no user is currently logged in.\n- `403`: **Unauthorised user**: the service will return this code if the current user is not an administrator.\n- `500`: For other types of error.",

If there is a match, [`200`], the service will return the matching term record.\n\nIf the operation does not succeed, the service will return:\n\n- `401`: **No current user**: the service will return this code if no user is currently logged in.\n- `403`: **Unauthorised user**: the service will return this code if the current user is not an administrator.\n- `500`: For other types of error.\n\n**Note that this service will honour preferred enumerations, this means that if a term is matched that has a preferred alternative, the latter will be returned, regardless if the preferred term does not belong to the provided path**.",

If there is a match, [`200`], the service will return the path starting from the enumeration root element to the term whose `_lid` property contains a match for the identifier provided in the `code` parameter. The result is an array in which each element is an object representing a path constituted by a list of edges and a list of vertices.\n\n- `vertices`: List of vertice terms.\n- `edges`: List of edge records.\n- `weights`: List of vertex weights.\n\nIf the operation does not succeed, the service will return:\n\n- `401`: **No current user**: the service will return this code if no user is currently logged in.\n- `403`: **Unauthorised user**: the service will return this code if the current user is not an administrator.\n- `500`: For other types of error.\n\n**Note that this service will honour preferred enumerations, this means that if a term is matched that has a preferred alternative, the latter will be returned, regardless if the preferred term does not belong to the provided path**.",
