It will *scan all properties* and *validate* any property that *corresponds* to an *element of the data dictionary*.\n\nThe service expects the following properties in the request body:\n\n- `value`: An array containing the objects to be validated.\n- `language`: The `iso_396_3` language code for status messages.\n\nThe `language` code is used to select the language of the status messages:\n\n- if the language code is `all`, the message will be returned in\nall available languages,\n- if the language code is wrong, or there is no message in that language,\nthe message will be returned in English.\n\nLanguage codes are in the form: `iso_639_3_` followed by the three letter ISO language code.\nUse `iso_639_3_eng` for English.\n\nIf the service is successful, [`200`], it will return three properties:\n\n- `valid`: An array containing the list of valid objects.\n- `warnings`: An array containing the report for objects containing warnings, such as resolved values.\n- `errors`: An array containing the report for objects containing errors.\n\nThe elements returned for warnings and errors are structured as follows:\n\n- `value`: The tested value, with eventual resolved enumerations.\n- `status`: An array of status reports.\n\nThe `status` objects indicate the outcome of the validation, they record any warning or error.\nThis status has two default elements: a `code` that is a numeric code, `0` means success,\nand a `message` string that describes the outcome. Depending on the eventual error, the status may\ninclude other properties such as:\n\n- `value`: the value that caused the error.\n- `descriptor`: the descriptor involved in the error.\n- `elements`: in case an array has too little or too much elements.\n- `property`: missing required property, in case of incorrect data definition.\n- `block`: data definition section.\n- `type`: unimplemented or invalid data type, or data definition section name.\n- `required`: list of required properties, in case one is missing.\n- `range`: valid range, in the case of out of range values.\n- `regexp`: regular expression, in case a string does not match.\n\n\nIf the operation does not succeed, the service will return:\n\n- `401`: **No current user**: the service will return this code if no user is currently logged in.\n- `403`: **Unauthorised user**: the service will return this code if the current user is not an administrator.\n- `500`: For other types of error.",
